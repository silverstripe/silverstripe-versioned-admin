Feature: View a version
  As a cms author
  I want to view a version

  Background:
    Given a "page" "Home" with "Content"="Welcome to my website"
    Given I am logged in with "ADMIN" permissions
    And I go to "/admin/pages"
    And I click on "Home" in the tree
    And I click on "History" in the header tabs
    Then I should see a list of versions

  Scenario: I can view a selected version of a record
    When I click on the first version
    Then I should see "Welcome to my website"

  Scenario: The form fields shown are readonly
    When I click on the first version
    Then I should see an "#Form_versionForm_Title[readonly]" element
    And I should see an "#Form_versionForm_URLSegment[readonly]" element

#Feature: Revert to a version
#  As a CMS author
#  I want to revert to an older version
#  So that I can easily switch back to older content
#
#  Background:
#    Given a "page" "Home" with "Content"="Initial version"
#    And I have a config file "enable-historyviewer.yml"
#
#    Given I am logged in with "ADMIN" permissions
#    And I go to "/admin/pages"
#    And I click on "Home" in the tree
#    And I fill in the "Content" HTML field with "<p>Second version</p>"
#    And I press the "Save" button
#    And I go to "/admin/pages/history/show/1"
#    And I wait for 3 seconds
#    Then I should see a list of versions
#
#  Scenario: I can revert to the initial version
#    When I click on version "1"
#    Then I should see "Initial version"
#    And I should see "Revert to this version"
#
#    Given I press the "Revert to this version" button
#    Then I should see a list of versions
#    And I should see "Successfully reverted to version 1"
#
#  Scenario: The latest version cannot be reverted to
#    When I click on the first version
#    And I wait for 3 seconds
#    Then I should see "Revert to this version"
#    And the "Revert to this version" button should be disabled
